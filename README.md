sofa_adaptations_in_Ruby
=======================

Attempts at testing and using SOFA libs in Ruby hopefully within compliance of the software license and usage.

lib dir has a working shared object that may be used for all functions. see libs/libCalendars/test_libcalendars.rb

so far it works with those. more to come.
