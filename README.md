sofa_adaptations_in_Ruby
=======================

Attempts at testing and using SOFA libs in Ruby/JRuby FFI hopefully within compliance of the software license and usage.

lib dir has libsofa_c.so Ruby and libsofa_c.a for C. include dir has the headers. 

libs dir is a breakdown of src to types of functions and reference. This is a work in progress and experimentation.
